# Problem 8.3 - A magic index in an array A[0 ... n-1] is defined to be an
#               index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct,
#               write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array
#               A.
#               FOLLOW UP: What if the values are not distinct?

def find_magic_index(A):
